## Overview

This is a simple "Hello World" program written in C#.

The purpose for creating this is to re-familiarize myself with C# and get my development environment in order.

## Development Environment

For this project I used Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit, C# and IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extensions.

I am using the C# language, an object oriented, cross platform C derivative language created by Microsoft.
